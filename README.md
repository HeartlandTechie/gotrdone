## About Gotrdone

A new idea for an online group . . . a little inspiration from the Roadkill show . . . doing whatever it takes to get something in motion.  Listening to my wife's group call this morning helping with 
dissertation discussions it hit me that was what would be handy for car people too. 
Staring at a hunk of metal in the garage is one thing, but doing one little thing each day . . . that is what gets it on the road.
